# Welcome to The Gift Hub
*The Gift Hub is an online portal where you, your friends, and your family can all organize any gift-giving occasion.*

## Features
---
The Gift Hub allows you to do a variety of things, including:

- Create your own gifts and choose who can see them
- Reserve gifts for others
- Inform others of which events you participate in

Below are detailed descriptions on each facet of The Gift Hub

### Groups
Giving is better in groups. Define as many groups as you want, and you have ultimate control over what is shown to whom. Make a group for your family, your friends - all you need is their email to add them!

### Gifts
The Gift Hub is all about gifts! We allow every user to keep a personal collection of gifts that he or she might want, and we give the user utmost control over who can view this gift. In fact, a gift can be viewable to everyone - or no one - and anywhere in between.
Additionally, reserve gifts on other's lists, without that user knowing! This makes planning a gift a breeze!

### Events
At the end of the day, giving is about getting together and celebrating a common cause. Here at The Gift Hub, we want to celebrate that, which is why The Gift Hub allows every user to define events they celebrate, with some default events provided right out of the box. Better yet, harness the same privacy controls utilized for gifts and pick exactly who can see what you celebrate.

This would not have been possible without the help of my father and my girlfriend, both of whom have worked, and continue to work, immensely hard to make this a reality. This could not have become a reality without them!
