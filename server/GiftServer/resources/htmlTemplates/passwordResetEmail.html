            Looks like you need to reset your password Gift Registry. To do so, just click <a id="passwordReset" href="">here</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            If you didn't request a password reset, this means someone has attempted to access your account - don't worry, they failed. However, to prevent further access, you should definitely change your password. Click <a id="changePassword" href="">here</a> to go to our main website.
