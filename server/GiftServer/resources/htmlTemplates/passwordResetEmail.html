    <h1>Hey There</h1>
    <p>
        Looks like you need to reset your password. To do so, just click <a id="passwordReset" href="">here</a>.
    </p>

        If you didn't request a password reset, this means someone has attempted to access your account - don't worry, they failed. However, to prevent further access, you should definitely change your password. Click <a id="changePassword" href="">here</a> to go to our main website.

    <button id="passwordResetBtn" class="btn btn-danger" href="" type="button">
        Reset Password
    </button>
